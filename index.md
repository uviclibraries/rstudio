Its interface is organized so that the you can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time. It also offers an Import-Wizard-like feature that allows users to import CSV, Excel, SPSS, and other file types into RStudio without having to write the code to do so." - [Kent State University Libraries](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/statconsulting/r){:target="_blank"}
