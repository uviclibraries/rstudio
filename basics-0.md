**Note**: This section is being reorganized. We thank you for your patience as we restructure the order of the content in this workshop.

# 1. Objects

The key to understanding R is that you will be working with what we 
call "objects". Anything in R can be an object: a number, a string of 
characters, a data frame with data, and even plots. 

To create any object:

- The command will begin with the name of the new object
- followed by: - an assignment operator `<-`
- and then the data or expression that defines the content of the
  object.

-This can include direct values, function calls, operations, or other
objects.

``` r
objectName <- "word"
```

**Attention:** Object names are never wrapped in quotes. String/character 
values being assigned to an object must be wrapped in quotes. Object 
names cannot begin with anything other than an alphabetical character, 
but otherwise can contain special characters and numbers (\*\_13). Object
names cannot contain spaces, but string values can. 
<br> 

When we create objects, R keeps track of them, and you check all objects that you have created and that R is keeping track of in your Workspace panel.

To change the information stored in an object, simply reassign the value to the object. For example, to change the value assigned to the object created above to the number 100:

``` r
objectName <- 100
```
Therefore, as you see, you have to pay attention to not give a new object the same name as a previous object, otherwise R will simply overwrite the older object.

You can also use objects in function calls, for example, you type in `log(objectName)` to ask R calculate the log of the number stored in your object (100 in this case).

**Definition - ‚ÄúFunction‚Äù:** A set of instructions defined to perform a specific task.

-E.g., help() : ‚Äòhelp‚Äô is a function to get information

**Definition - ‚ÄúFunction call‚Äù:** The act of executing a function with
specific arguments, if required, to produce a result. <br>

- e.g., help(‚Äúinteger‚Äù)
- This calls the ‚Äòhelp‚Äô function with the argument (aka parameter)
  ‚Äúinteger‚Äù
- It will return information about an ‚Äòinteger‚Äô object type.
- You can use objects as arguments in functions.

# 2. Data Types

While R objects can take many forms, when they store data (rather than, for example, a plot call), R primarily uses six basic data types. Let‚Äôs start by looking at the main types of data that you will be using for 99.99% of the time:

- *Numeric*: Decimal or floating-point numbers (e.g., 4.5, -3.2).

- *Integer*: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, -5, 20). In R, integers are often
   just treated as numeric unless explicitly specified.

- *Logical*: Boolean values, either TRUE or FALSE.
  
- *Character*: Text or strings (e.g., ‚Äúhello‚Äù, ‚Äú1234‚Äù). Note: "1234" is treated as character because it is between quotes. If you want it to be numeric, you don't need the quotes.

- *Factor*: A special type of character data, includes levels
  or an order (e.g., ‚Äúlow‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù,  ‚Äúhigh‚Äù).

In the exercises below, you will get used to working with these different types  of data. First, let's look at basic operations with objects with **character data**.

Note: whenever you enter a string parameter, the string will more likely
than not be wrapped in quotes. If it doesn‚Äôt work, add or remove quotes.

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-1</u>

**Create an object.**

Create an object for a pig‚Äôs first name. The first pig's first name is "Bart".

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# Assign the first name 'Bart' to the first pig (pig1)
pig1.first_name <- "Bart"
```
**Note:** You might have created an object with a different name, which is 
completely okay (as long as it is an understandable name; remember the best
practices for naming objects from the previous section). However, we will 
continue using the object `pig1.first_name` for this activity, so you might 
want to use the same name to make it easier to follow.
</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-2</u>

**Create an object.**

Create an object for Bart‚Äôs last name. Bart's last name is "Smith".

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# Assign the last name 'Smith' to the first pig (pig1)
pig1.last_name <- "Smith"
```

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-3</u>

**Create an object.**

Create an object that equals Bart‚Äôs first and last name, then display
the full name in the console <br>

The `paste()` function combines two strings and inserts a space between
them. `paste()` takes two arguments, like `paste(string1, string2)`

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# Concatenate the first pig's (pig1) first ('Bart') and last name ('Smith')
pig1.full_name <- paste(pig1.first_name, pig1.last_name)

# After pig1.full_name has been created, print (display) Bart‚Äôs full name...
pig1.full_name
```

    ## [1] "Bart Smith"

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

Now we‚Äôll look at basic operations with **numeric and integer
data**. First, we‚Äôll create height information for Bart and find out
how much he‚Äôs grown in height.

<br>

<img src="images/rstudio-basics-Bart.png" alt="Bart as a piglet and adult" style="width:420px;"/>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-4</u>

**Create an object.**

Create an object for Bart‚Äôs height as a piglet: 10

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# Assign the value of Bart‚Äôs piglet height
pig1.heightA <- 10
```

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-5</u>

**Create an object.**

Create an object for Bart‚Äôs height now: 22.3

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# Assign the value of Bart's current height
pig1.heightB <- 22.3
```

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-6</u>

**Create an object.**

Now create an object expressing the amount he‚Äôs grown.

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# Find the difference in height using the expression: 'heightB - heightA' 
# using the subtraction operator. 
pig1.heightGain <- pig1.heightB - pig1.heightA

# after pig1.heightGain has been created, print (display) the value of pig.heightGain...

pig1.heightGain
```

    ## [1] 12.3

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

*Hint:* ‚ÄúExpressing‚Äù indicates that the value will require an
expression, in this case, a mathematical operation.

</div>

<br>

`pig1.heightA` is an ‚Äòinteger‚Äô data type (whole number)

`pig1.heightB` is a ‚Äònumeric‚Äô data type (decimal number)

R can perform operations on different data types, like getting the
difference of a value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

üìç As you work through these activities, remember to save your script(s)
regularly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To remove objects from your environment, execute the ‚Äòremove‚Äô
function in the console: `rm()`, e.g.¬†`rm(full_name)`.

<br>

**Time for logical or boolean values!**

We can denote whether Bart is small or large with a Boolean value.

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.1-7</u>

**Create two objects.**

Create two objects (pig1.mini and pig1.large) containing Boolean values
which indicates that Bart is a large pig and not a mini pig.

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
pig1.mini <- FALSE

pig1.large <- TRUE
```

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

*Hint:* Boolean values are either ‚ÄòTRUE‚Äô or ‚ÄòFALSE‚Äô (case sensitive).

</div>

<br>

# 3. Data structure
<!-- Diana stopped the updating here -->
## 3.1 Vectors

A vector is a 1-dimensional list of items that are of the same data type
(all character, all numeric, etc.)

To create a vector object, you will use the `c()` function. <br>

- The ‚Äòc‚Äô stands for ‚Äòcombine‚Äô.

- It‚Äôs used to create a vector by grouping individual values into a
  list-like structure.

- Think of it as placing items into a container where each item remains
  distinct and can be individually accessed.

  - For example, `vector1 <- c(value1, value2)` creates a vector named
    ‚Äòvector1‚Äô containing the elements ‚Äòvalue1‚Äô and ‚Äòvalue2‚Äô as separate
    items in a sequence, not as a single merged item.

  - A value in a vector can be accessed by using square brackets and its
    index (the value‚Äôs place in the vector), where **1** is the first
    index.

    - `vector1[1]` will output: ‚Äòvalue1‚Äô

<br>

As you might have seen if you tested the help() function by looking up
information on vectors, you will know that <!--check its output--> many
functions and operations in R are designed to work naturally with
vectors.

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.2-1</u>

**Create a vector.**

Make a vector for the following weight values of miniature goats. Name
your variable ‚Äògoat.weights‚Äô

`Goat weights: 13.3, 17.2, 14.8, 14.6, 12.4`

<br>

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
# The period between 'goat' and 'weight' has no special purpose. 
# It only shows the person reading the code that 'weights' is information that pertains to the goats
goat.weights <- c(13.3, 17.2, 14.8, 14.6, 12.4)
```

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

The command you just ran has now appeared in your console (bottom left
window)

- the goat.weight vector is now listed in the Environment tab (top right
  window) under <u>Values</u>.<br>

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.2-2</u>

**View objects.**

Show the contents of the vector containing the goat weights.

If at any point you want to view the value of an object, you can
just type the name of the object in the console and type ‚Äòenter‚Äô 
or ‚Äòreturn‚Äô to execute. 

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
goat.weights
```

    ## [1] 13.3 17.2 14.8 14.6 12.4

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.2-3</u>

**View objects.**

Display the weight of the second goat in the vector.

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
goat.weights[2]
```

    ## [1] 17.2

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

*Hint:* `data_object_name[indexNumber]`

</div>

<br>

You have just worked with numeric vectors. Now let‚Äôs move to character
vectors.

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.2-4</u>

**Create a new vector.**

Make a vector for the following name values of miniature goats.

Name your variable `goat.name`

Goat names: baby, pickles, cookie, sparkle, gabbie

**Note:** Text values must be wrapped in quotations. You can use double
or single quotes, but must be consistent - Good: `"text"` - Good:
`'text'` - Bad: `'text"`

<br>

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
goat.name <- c("baby", "pickes", "cookie", "sparkle", "gabbie")
```

</details>

{::options parse_block_html='false'/}

</div>

<br>

To get the length of a vector, we can use the <code>length()</code>
function.

<br>

<div class="task-box" markdown="1">

‚≠ê <u>Task 1.2-5</u>

**View information about vectors.**

Display the length of the vector of miniature goat names.

{::options parse_block_html='true' /}
<details>
<summary>
Check your code
</summary>

``` r
length(goat.name)
```

    ## [1] 5

## 3.2. Dataframes

If you want to create 2D lists, also known as a table, you will create a 
data.frame suing the `data.frame()` function or a matrix using the 
`matrix()` function. 
<br> - Instead of creating our own data.frames, we will be importing data

## 3.3. Matrices
- For more on matrices,
[check me
out](https://www.w3schools.com/r/r_matrices.asp){:target=‚Äú\_blank‚Äù}.
<br>
later on.

## 3.4. Lists

A ‚Äòlist‚Äô can hold items of different types (even vectors), while items
in a ‚Äòvector‚Äô must all be the same type. <br>

To make a list, we‚Äôll use the `list()` function.

**Hint:** Remember that all items in a vector must be the same type, but
can be different types if in a list.
